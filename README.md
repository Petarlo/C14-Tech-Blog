  The aim of this project was to build a CMS-Style blog site that allowed users to publish new blog posts, as well as comment on other users posts.
  The app was required to follow the MVC paradigm and use Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
  The finished product was to be deployed via Heroku.
